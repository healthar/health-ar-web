# Our story
Have you ever needed to think about where you will go to the bathroom? 

Probably not, but that is a very real and constant problem for trans people. But it's not just that. During social outings or when the need for a doctor arises, the thoughts at the top of their minds is always "will I be harassed or treated unfairly". 

This constant fear of the unknown can be crippling to some trans people and others in the LGBT community. However, the need for better information on inclusive spaces still goes unfulfilled. The current solutions either lacks in features or suffer from poor implementation.

# How we tackle this issue
Our team will service this need with **Inclusive Maps~**, a responsive web application that uses crowd sourced information to help members of the LGBT community feel more safe and comfortable, and for their allies to make better decisions on where to take their business. 

**Inclusive Maps** not only reduces one of the most common pain points for the LGBT community, but also lays down the ground work for social change by increasing the availability of this critical information. 

## What it does
1) Highlights inclusive healthcare providers, schools, and bathrooms that serve Transgender or gender-non conforming people.

2) Allows inclusive rating for any other locations in Google Maps.

3) Paints the inclusive nature of a neighborhood or city by highlighting negative experiences. 

# How we built it
1) We talked to people who identifed as trans and compiled the pain points of thier daily experiences.

2) We looked at current solutions and analyzed why it works and why it ultimately falls short.

3) Through the above research, we narrowed down our scope to focus on the 3 major categories of pain points: **Medical Services**, **Bathrooms**, and **Educational Facilities**. 

4) With the goal of crowd sourced reviews, we aimed for a responsive web application that is easily accessible on computers and phones -- the primary places of usage for this app.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our team diversity allowing us to meet a specific challenge with the highest possible impact, and completing a beautiful and working prototype. 

# What's next for Inclusive Maps
##### Make the application public, grow the user base and receive feedback.
##### Create a global reach by mapping inclusive locations all around the world.
##### Incorporate an Accessible Infrastructure category for disabled people to gauge accessible locations and cities.
##### Increase the ease of using Inclusive Maps by creating something like a Google Chrome Extension that embeds our reviews directly into Google Maps.

# Broken by design
Transgender people are not considered in local infrastructure and have difficulty accessing inclusive services such as healthcare or education.

# Our design is better

## Inspiration
More than **50%** of transgender male teens report attempting **suicide** in their lifetime. This is (partly) becase transgender people have difficulty finding the right healthcare providers and other services, especially when choosing the wrong service may result in harassment or discrimination.

A large amount of **gender and sexuality based discrimination occurs in public bathrooms** and many gender non-conforming people are actively seeking a solution that **maps unisex public restroom locations**.

## What it does
1) Maps healthcare providers that serve Transgender or gender-non conforming people.

2) Maps inclusive restrooms by flagging

3) Identifies problematic infrastructure

4) Encourages better design through community engagement 

5) Makes the world more inclusive and feminist.

## How we built it
Analyzing the problem from a **stakeholder focused perspective**.

## Challenges we ran into
**Addressing the root of the issue** vs the cause.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our team diversity allowing us to meet a specific challenge with the highest possible impact.

## What we learned
Understanding **WHY** is more important than understanding the **HOW** to improve a situation.

## What's next for Inclusive Maps
Social media promotion, secure platform development, expansion into other community areas in need of improvement.

## Our motto
Be **better**.
